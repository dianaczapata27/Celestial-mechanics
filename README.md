# Celestial Mechanics Projects

This repository contains several computational projects developed during the Celestial Mechanics course. Each project focuses on a different aspect of celestial motion, using tools like Astroquery, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

### 1. Solar System Orbits

Using `Astroquery` and `Matplotlib`, I created a 3D plot of the orbits of the planets in the Solar System (excluding dwarf planets). The goal was to reproduce as closely as possible the diagram provided by the professor as a reference.
